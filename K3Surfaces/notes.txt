The following surfaces have no viable zetas, so I messed up the counting somewhere. 
Maybe even messed up the counting for the whole batch of them. 
I'm not exactly sure which of the several methods I used to compute for them.
They are all in quadratic 15 or 16.
Maybe this implies that the current counting for quadratics, the one that's going on for 17s currently, is not viable. 
Actually, nevermind. These are the last 4 orbits counted for in the 15s using the "old" method. 
I recall this was the batch that was not being saved. Maybe just these are problematic. The rest all work.
