This exercise is taken from HW1 as, unfortunately, the hint for question 1 was missing. As the techniques and the result are important, I put it back.

Let $U$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{C}$ and $D \subset \Omega$ be a closed disk.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $f : U \to \mathbb{C}$ be a $C^1$ function. Show that for all $z \in D$, we have:
    \[
    f(z) = \frac{1}{2i\pi} \int_{\partial D} \frac{f(\xi)}{\xi - z} d\xi + \frac{1}{2i\pi} \int_D \frac{\partial f}{\partial \bar{z}}(\xi) \frac{d\xi \wedge d\bar{\xi}}{\xi - z}.
    \]
    \textit{Hint: You can apply the Stokes formula to $\frac{f(\xi)}{\xi-z} d\xi$ on $D \setminus B(z, \epsilon)$ and let $\epsilon \to 0$.}

    \item Let $g$ be a $C^1$ function on $\mathbb{C}$ with compact support and let:
    \[
    f(z) = \frac{1}{2i\pi} \int_{\mathbb{C}} \frac{g(\xi)}{\xi - z} d\xi \wedge d\bar{\xi}.
    \]
    Show that $f$ is a $C^1$ function and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \bar{z}} = g$.

    \textit{Hint: you can differentiate under the integral sign after the change of variable $\xi' = \xi - z$, then change back and conclude using the formula from the first question.}

    \item Show that for any function $g$ on $U$ which is $C^1$, there exists $f$ which is $C^1$ on $U$ such that $\partial f/\partial \bar{z} = g$ on $D$.

    \item In the last question, show that if $g$ is $C^\infty$, then $f$ can be chosen $C^\infty$. Show also that if $g$ depends smoothly (or holomorphically) on other parameters, then so does $f$.

\textbf{Holomorphic $\bar{\partial}$-Dolbeault Lemma.} Let $U$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{C}^n$ and $D$ an open polydisk with closure contained in $U$. Let $0 \le p \le n$, $1 \le q \le n$. The goal of this exercise is to prove that any $(p, q)$-form $\bar{\partial}$-closed on $U$ has a restriction to $D$ which is $\bar{\partial}$-exact.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prove that we can reduce to the case where $p = 0$. \textit{Hint: show that each form $\alpha \in \mathcal{A}^{p,q}(U)$ can be written as $\alpha = \sum_{|I|=p} \alpha_I \wedge dz^I$ with $\alpha_I \in \mathcal{A}^{0,q}(U)$ uniquely determined by $\alpha$.}

    \item Let $\alpha \in \Omega^{0,q}(U)$. Show that there exists $1 \le k \le n$ such that $\alpha = dz^k \wedge \gamma + \delta$ and $\gamma, \delta$ are forms in the subalgebra generated by $dz^i$, $1 \le i \le k - 1$.

    \item Prove the result by induction on $k$. \textit{Hint: you can consider a form $\mu \in \mathcal{A}^{0,q-1}$ obtained from $\gamma$ by replacing each coefficient $f \in C^\infty(D)$ by a function $g \in C^\infty$ such that $\partial g/\partial z^k = f$ on $D$. Show that if $\bar{\partial}\alpha = 0$, then we can choose $\mu$ such that $\bar{\partial}\mu = dz^k \wedge \gamma + \nu$ where $\nu$ can be expressed only in terms of $dz^1, \dots, dz^{k-1}$ and $C^\infty(U)$.}

\textbf{Dolbeault cohomology of the open disk.} Let $D$ be an open disk in $\mathbb{C}$ or $D = \mathbb{C}$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $g \in C^\infty(D)$. Show that there exists $f \in C^\infty(D)$ such that $\partial f/\partial \bar{z} = g$.

    \textit{Hint: choose a sequence of disks $D_n \subset D$ such that $D_n \subset D_{n+1}$ and $\bigcup_n D_n = D$. Construct $f_n \in C^\infty(D)$ such that $\partial f_n/\partial \bar{z} = g$ on $D_n$ and such that $|f_{n+1} - f_n| \le 2^{-n}$ on $D_{n-1}$. Show that $f_n$ converges to a function $f$ that solves the problem.}

    \item Compute the Dolbeault cohomology groups of $D$.

Let $\mathbb{P}^3(\mathbb{C})$ denote the complex projective 3-space with homogeneous coordinates $x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3$. Consider the complex submanifold
\[
X := \{x \in \mathbb{P}^3(\mathbb{C}) \mid x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4 = 0\}.
\]
Let $M$ be the underlying $C^\infty$ manifold of $X$ and let $I$ denote the corresponding complex structure. Show that $(M, I)$ and $(M, -I)$ are isomorphic as complex manifolds. How can you generalize this example?
