\begin{problem}{1}
    The complexity class $\mathrm{DP}$ (which stands for “difference-P”) is defined as follows:
    \[ \mathrm{DP} = \{ A \setminus B : A \in \mathrm{NP} \text{ and } B \in \mathrm{NP} \}.\]
    Prove that the language
    \[ \text{EXACT-IND-SET} = \{ \langle G, k \rangle : G \text{ is a graph with } \alpha(G) = k \} \]
    is $\mathrm{DP}$-complete under (deterministic) polynomial-time reductions. Here, $\alpha(G)$ is the independence number of $G$, defined as the size of a maximum independent set of $G$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
    We first show that $\text{EXACT-IND-SET}$ is in DP and then that it is DP-Complete. \\
