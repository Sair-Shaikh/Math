\begin{problem}{3}(The Hodge Decomposition for Curves)
    Let $X$ be a compact connected complex curve. We have the differential:
    \[d: \calO \to \Omega_X\]
    between the sheaf of homolormphic functions and the sheaf of holomorphic differentials.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(a)] Show that $d$ is surjective with kernel equal to the constant sheaf $\C$. Hence, we have an exact sequence: 
        \[ 0 \to \C \to \calO \rightarrow \to \Omega_X \to 0\]
        \item[(b)] Deduce from Serre duality that $H^1(X, \Omega_X) \cong \C$. Deduce from Poincare duality that $H^2(X, \C) = \C$. 
        \item[(c)] Show that $(6.15)$ induces a short exact sequence: 
        \[ 0 \to H^0(X, \Omega_X) \to H^1(X, \C) \to H^1(X, \calO_X) \to 0\]
        \item[(d)] Show that the map which to a holomorphic form $\alpha$ associates the class of $\overline{\alpha}$ in $H^1(X, \calO)$ is injective.
        \item[(e)] Deduce from Serre duality that it is also surjective and that we have the decomposiiton: 
        \[ H^1(X, \C) = H^0(X, \Omega_X) \oplus \overline{H^0(X, \Omega_X)}\]
        with 
        \[ \overline{H^0(X, \Omega_X)} \cong H^1(X, \calO)\]
    \end{enumerate}
