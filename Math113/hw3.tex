    Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are normed vector spaces. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Show that $\mathcal{L}(X, Y)$ is a normed vector space with respect to the the operator norm defined in lecture such that: 
        \[ ||T(x)|| \leq ||T|| ||x|| \]
        \item Show that if $S \in \mathcal{L}(Y, Z)$. Then, 
        \[  ||ST|| \leq ||S||||T|| \]

    Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are Banach spaces with $T \in \mathcal{L}(X, Y)$. Suppose that $E$ is a closed proper subspace of $X$ such that $E \subset \ker(T)$. Show that there is a unique operator $\overline{T} \in \mathcal{L}(X/E, Y)$ such that $\overline{T}(q(x)) = T(x)$ for all $x \in X$ where $q: X \to X/E$ is the quotient map. Moreover, $||\overline{T}|| = ||T||$.

    Let $X$ be a normed vector space. A Banach space $\tilde{X}$ is called a completion of $X$ is there is an isometric isomorphism $\iota: X \to \tilde{X}$ onto a dense subspace of $\tilde{X}$. Show that any two completions $(tilde{X}_1, \iota_1)$ and $(\tilde{X}_2, \iota_2)$ are isometrically isomorphic by an isomorphism: 
    \[ \Phi: \tilde{X}_1 \to \tilde{X}_2\]
    such that $\Phi(\iota_1(x)) = \iota_2(x)$ for all $x \in X$.

    Lets find a use for a genuine Minkowski functional. In this problem, we'll let $l_\R^\infty$ be the real Banach space of bounded sequences in $\R$. Define $m$ on $l_\R^\infty$: 
    \[ m(x) = \limsup_n x_n\]
    We clearly have $m(tx) = tm(x)$ if $t \geq 0$ and it is not hard to check that $m(x+y) \leq m(x) + m(y)$ for all $x, y \in l_\R^\infty$. We want to show that there are Banach limits or what I prefer to call a generalized limit on $l_\R^\infty$. This is we want to show that there is a functional $L \in l_\R^{\infty^*}$ such that:
    \[ L(S(x)) = L(x)\] 
    where $S \in \mathcal{L}(l_\R^\infty)$ is given by $S(x)_n = x_{n+1}$ and such that $\liminf_n x_n \leq L(x) \leq \limsup_n x_n$. (Hint provided).

    Prove the following Lemma from lecture. Let $X$ be a complex vector space. Every real linear functional of $X$ is the real part of a complex linear functional on $X$. In fact, if $\phi = \Re(\psi)$ then $\psi(x) = \phi(x) - i\phi(ix)$.
