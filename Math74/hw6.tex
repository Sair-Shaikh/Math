    (1.3.18) For a path-connected, locally path-connected, and semilocally simply connected space $X$, call a path-connected covering $p \colon E \to X$ \emph{abelian} if it is normal and has abelian deck transformation group. Show that $X$ has an abelian covering space that is a covering space of every other abelian covering space of $X$ and that such a `universal' abelian covering space is unique up to equivalence. Describe this covering space explicitly for $X = S^1 \vee S^1$ and $S^1 \vee S^1 \vee S^1$. 
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
    Since $X$ is path-connected, locally path-connected, and semilocally simply connected, we note that it it has a universal cover $\tilde\rho: \tilde{B} \to X$. Let $H \subseteq G := \pi_1(X, x_0)$ be the commutator (i.e. generated by elements $[g, h]$ for $g, h \in G$). By the existence of covers theorem, there exists a covering space $\rho: (E, e_0) \to (X, x_0)$ such that $\rho_*(\pi_1(E, e_0)) = H$. We claim that $(E, \rho)$ is the unique universal abelian covering space of $X$. \bbni
    Note that since $H$ is the commutator subgroup, it is normal. To see this, let $[a,b] \in H$ be a generator, and $g \in G$. Then, 
    \begin{align*}
        g[a,b]g^{-1} &= ga^{-1}b^{-1}abg^{-1} \\
        &= ga^{-1}(g^{-1}g)b^{-1}(g^{-1}g)a(g^{-1}g)bg^{-1} \\
        &= (ga^{-1}g^{-1})(gb^{-1}g^{-1})(gag^{-1})(gbg^{-1}) \\
        &= (gag^{-1})^{-1}(gbg^{-1})^{-1}(gag^{-1})(gbg^{-1}) \\
        &= [gag^{-1}, gbg^{-1}] \in H
    \end{align*}
    Thus, $H$ is normal in $G$ and $(E, \rho)$ is a normal covering space. \bbni
    Moreover, by the normal covering theorem, we know that the deck transformation group is equal to $G/H$. However, since $H$ is the commutator, we have that $G/H$ is abelian (by definition of the commutator). Thus, $(E, \rho)$ is an abelian covering space. \bbni
    Moreover, if $(E', \rho')$ was another normal cover corresponding to $H' \subseteq G$ with abelian deck transformation group $G/H'$, then since $G/H'$ is abelian, we must have that $H \subseteq H'$ (the commutator must be quotiented out for the result to be abelian). Thus, we have that:
    \[ \rho_*(\pi_1(E, e_0)) \subseteq \rho_*'(\pi_1(E', e_0'))\]
    Since $E$ is path-connected and locally path-connected (as it is a cover of locally path-connected $X$), we can apply the general lifting theorem to get a map $f: (E, e_0) \to (E', e_0')$ such that:
    \[ \rho' \circ f = \rho \]
    By functoriality, we have that:
    \[ \rho'_* \circ f_* = \rho_* \]
    Since $\rho_*$ is injective, we have that $f_*$ is injective. Thus, 
    \[ f_*(\pi_1(E, e_0)) \subseteq \pi_1(E', e_0')\]
    is a subgroup. Thus, by the Galois correspondence, we have that $f: (E, e_0) \to (E', e_0')$ is a covering map. \bbni 
    Uniqueness follows directly from the universal property. If $A, B$ are two universal abelian covers, then by the universal property, there exists unique covering maps $f: A \to B$ and $g: B \to A$ that commute with the covering maps of $A$ and $B$. However, then $g \circ f$ is a covering map from $A$ to itself. By the uniqueness of lifts, we must have $g \circ f = \id_A$. Similarly, we have that $f \circ g = \id_B$. Thus, $f$ and $g$ are homeomorphisms, and the universal abelian cover is unique up to equivalence. \bbni 
    For $X = S^1 \vee S^1$, we have that $\pi_1(S^1 \vee S^1) = \Z * \Z$. The commutator subgroup $H$ is generated by the element $[a, b]$. Thus, we want a cover of $S^1 \vee S^1$ corresponding to $H$. Let $E = \R^2$, where we each integer interval on the $x$-axis corresponds to $a$ and on the $y$-axis corresponds to $b$.
