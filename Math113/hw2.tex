    Show that $X$ is compact if and only if given any family $\mathcal{F}$ of closed sets of $X$ with the finite intersection property, we have $\bigcap_{F \in \mathcal{F}} F \neq \emptyset$.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$(\implies$)] Assume $X$ is compact. We will prove that contrapositive. Let $\{F_\alpha\}$ be a family of closed sets such that: 
        \[ \bigcap_{\alpha} F_\alpha = \emptyset \]
        Let $\{U_\alpha\}$ be a family of open sets such that $U_\alpha = X \setminus F_\alpha$. Then, we have:
        \[ \bigcup_\alpha U_\alpha = X \setminus \bigcap_\alpha F_\alpha = X\]
        Thus, $\{U_\alpha\}$ is an open cover of $X$. Since $X$ is compact, there exists a finite subcover of $\{U_\alpha\}$. Let $\{U_1, \ldots, U_n\}$ be the finite subcover. Then, we have:
        \[ \bigcap_{i=1}^n F_i = X \setminus \bigcap_{i=1}^n U_i = \emptyset\]
        Thus, we have found a finite subset of $\{F_\alpha\}$ with empty intersection. Thus, $\{F_\alpha\}$ does not have the finite intersection property. Therefore, by the contrapositive, any family of closed sets with the finite intersection property has non-empty intersection.
        \item[($\impliedby$)] Assume any family of closed sets with the finite intersection property has non-empty intersection. By the contrapositive, this implies that if the family has empty intersection, it cannot have the finite intersection property. \bbni 
        Let $\{U_\alpha\}$ be an open cover of $X$. To show that $X$ is compact it suffices to show that there exists a finite subcover of $\{U_\alpha\}$. Let $\{F_\alpha\}$ be the family of closed sets such that $F_\alpha = X \setminus U_\alpha$. Then, 
        \[ \bigcap_{\alpha} F_\alpha = X \setminus \bigcup_\alpha U_\alpha  = \emptyset \]
        Thus, $\{F_\alpha\}$ does not have the finite intersection property. Therefore, there exists a finite subset of $\{F_\alpha\}$, call it $\{F_1, \ldots, F_n\}$, such that: 
        \[ \bigcap_{i = 1}^n F_i = \emptyset \]
        However, we know that:
        \[ \bigcap_{i = 1}^n F_i = X \setminus \bigcup_{i=1}^n U_i \]
        Thus, we conclude that:
        \[X \setminus \bigcup_{i=1}^n U_i = \emptyset\]
        Thus, $\bigcup_{i=1}^n U_i = X$. Therefore, $\{U_1, \ldots, U_n\}$ is a finite subcover of $\{U_\alpha\}$. Therefore, $X$ is compact.

\begin{problab}{2}
    Let $X$ be a metric space. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Show that if $E$ is a compact subspace of $X$, then $E$ is closed. 
        \item Show that if $X$ is compact and $E$ is closed in $X$, then $E$ is compact.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problab}
\begin{solu}
    \bbni
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $E$ be a compact subspace of $X$. To show that $E$ is closed, it suffices to show that $X \setminus E$ is open. Let $x \in X \setminus E$. Then, we define to families of open sets, $\{U_e\}_{e \in E}$ and $\{V_e\}_{e \in E}$, such that:
        \begin{align*}
            U_e &= B_{\epsilon}(e) \text{ where } \epsilon < \rho(x,e)/2 \\
            V_e &= B_{\epsilon}(x) \text{ where } \epsilon < \rho(x,e)/2
        \end{align*} 
        Note that by definition, $x \in V_e$ for all $e \in E$ and that $U_e \cap V_e = \emptyset$. Moreover, by definition, $\{U_e\}_{e\in E}$ is an open cover of $E$. Since $E$ is compact, there exists a finite subcover of $\{U_e\}_{e \in E}$. Let $\{U_{e_1}, \ldots, U_{e_n}\}$ be the finite subcover. Then, since $\{V_{e_1}, \ldots, V_{e_n}\}$ is a finite collection of open sets, $V = \bigcap_{i=1}^n V_{e_n}$ is an open set that contains $x$. However, since $U_{e_i} \cap V_{e_i} = \emptyset$, and $V \subseteq V_{e_i}$, we have that $V \cap U_{e_i} = \emptyset$ for all $i$. Thus,
        \[  V \cap E = V \cap \bigcup_{i=1}^n U_{e_i} = \emptyset\]
        Thus, there exists an open set $V$ containing $x$ disjoint from $E$, thus contained in $X \setminus E$. Therefore, $X \setminus E$ is open. Thus, $E$ is closed.
        \item Assume $X$ is compact and $E$ is closed in $X$. If $E = X$, then we are done. Thus, assume $X \neq E$. Let $\{U_\alpha\}$ be an open cover of $E$ in $E$. Then, there exists a family of open sets $\{V_\alpha\}$ in $X$ where, for all $\alpha$,
        \[ U_\alpha = V_\alpha \cap E \]
        Note that since $U_\alpha \subseteq V_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$, $\{V_\alpha\}$ is an open cover for $E$ in $X$. Since $E$ is closed, $X \setminus E$ is open. Thus, $\{V_\alpha\} \cup \{X \setminus E\}$ is an open cover of $X$. Since $X$ is compact, there exists a finite subcover of $\{V_\alpha\} \cup \{X \setminus E\}$. \bbni 
        Let $\{V_{1}, \ldots, V_{n}, X \setminus E\}$, be the finite subcover. If the provided finite subcover does not contain $X \setminus E$, we can just add it while maintaining a finite subcover, we assume it does. Then, $V_1, \cdots, V_n$ is an open cover for $E$ in $X$. Then, we have:
        \[ \bigcup_{i=1}^n U_i = \bigcup_{i=1}^n (V_i \cap E) = \left(\bigcup_{i=1}^n V_i\right) \cap E = E \]
        Thus, $U_1, \ldots, U_n$ is a finite subcover of $U_\alpha$ in $E$. Therefore, $E$ is compact.

    We say that $D$ is dense in $X$ if $\overline{D} = X$. Show that $D$ is dense if and only if $D$ meets every non-empty open set in $X$. 
\end{problab}

\begin{solu}
    We use the fact that $x \in \overline{D}$ (is a point of closure) if and only if every open neighborhood of $x$ intersects $D$. This is in Royden-Fitzpatrick as the definition of closure, with Ch9.2, Proposition 3 and 4 proving that the closure is closed and the complement of an open.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[($\implies$)] Assume $D$ is dense in $X$. Let $U$ be a non-empty open set in $X$. Then, there exists a point $x \in U$. Since $\overline{D} = X$, $x \in \overline{D}$. Thus, every open neighborhood of $x$ intersects $D$. Thus, $U$ intersects $D$.
        \item[($\impliedby$)] Assume $D$ meets every non-empty open set in $X$. Let $x \in X$ be arbitrary. Then, $D$ meets every non-empty open set containing $x$. Thus, $x$ is a point of closure of $D$. Thus, $x \in \overline{D}$. Since $x$ is arbitrary, we have that $\overline{D} = X$. Thus, $D$ is dense in $X$.

    Show that a compact metric space has a countable dense subset. It is enough for the space to be totally bounded.
\end{problab}

\begin{solu}
    Let $(X, \rho)$ be a compact metric space. We define a countable set of open covers, indexed by $\mathbb{N}$, where $\mathcal{U}_n$ is the open cover: 
    \[ \mathcal{U}_n = \{ B_{1/n}(x) : x \in X\} \] 
    Then, for each $n$, the cover $\mathcal{U}_n$ has a finite subcover. Let $C_n$ be the centers of the balls in the finite subcover, for each $n$. The union of these sets over $n$ is countable, as it is a countable union of finite sets. Call this set $C$. We will show that $C$ is dense in $X$. \bbni
    Let $U$ be a non-empty open set in $X$. Then, there exists a point $x \in U$. Since $U$ is open, there exists an $\epsilon$, such that $B_\epsilon(x) \subseteq U$. Pick an $n$ such that $1/n < \epsilon$. Then, there exists a center $c \in C_n$ such that $x \in B_{1/n}(c)$ as $C_n$ is the set of centers of a finite cover made of $1/n$-balls. Thus, we have:
    \[\rho(x, c) < 1/n < \epsilon\]
    Thus, $c \in B_\epsilon(x) \subseteq U$. Therefore, $U$ intersects $C$. Since $U$ is arbitrary, every non-empty open set in $X$ intersects $C$. Thus, $C$ is dense in $X$. Therefore, $C$ is a countable dense subset of $X$.

    Show that an equicontinous family of functions on a compact metric space is uniformly equicontinous as in lecture. (Some texts do not define equicontinous at a point. Instead, whether $X$ is compact or not, equicontinuity is what we have called uniformly equicontinuous. Fortunately, there is no distinction for compact spaces.)
